        It is around this point of our yearly cycle in which I find myself at my lowest points of psycho-emotional stability:
        <br>every trough feels yet deeper than the last.
        <br>With a capricious yet imposing timing, mercurial temperaments of listless melancholy transform into manic & short-sighted suicidal ideation.
        <br>I am so tired of living my life like this—being perceived as I am by others around me.
        <br>I find no passion nor joy in schoolwork, and any such pleasure must be forcefully wrung out of music.
        <br>With that said, I am pleased to report that I am making solid progress on my next project
        <br>& I would like to share some more information about it with you.
        <br>
        <br>Laurels of the End of History is looking to be about 10-15 minutes long & I am very excited
        <br>to announce that it will be mixed, mastered, and co-produced by Anna Lily.
        <br>I’m looking at an early 2023 release. It will feature instrumental work from Anna herself,
        <br>as well as Farkas Aron (AKA Composition Booklet), Loto, Crochet, and others yet to be announced.</strong>

    It's ok that people have completely misunderstood the point of my album. It's ok that they don't like it.
    <br>Where I begin to take issues, however, is when people make their disliking of my album a matter of culture or authencitity.
<br> I have put more thought and work into this project than these people could ever know, they scrape the surface
<br> of my themes for superficial criticisms and then have the nerve to say things like "it is lost in translation" or
<br> "the passion is obviously there, it just comes across as a superficial impersonation." You don't even know what this 
<br>album is about in the first place. Your critical media analysis begins and ends with the title of the album and a quick
<br>glance through the lyrical content. But none of these people when they engage with my album critically dare to touch any
<br>of the album which is not historical, but is instead about me, about nearly dying, about transitioning, about discovering
<br>myself. They don't stop and think; the tagline "a story of two halves told in three parts about one People shattered into seven
<br>and one Person taping themselves back together" wasn't chosen haphazardly. The release date wasn't chosen haphazardly. The lyrical
<br>content wasn't chosen haphazardly. I don't want to hear claims of impersonation when these people cannot even bother to contemplate
<br>about what is really being said. Instead, they pontificate amongst themselves, poking fun until it's time to move on. None of these
<br>people ever bother to engage in a conversation with me, because they know they're in the wrong at the end of the day.
<br>These people could never begin to comprehend the care and passion that went behind every single thought going into this project &
<br>they either do not anticipate or fear vulnerability and authencitity in music. And in this regard, they simply prove a huge facet of
<br>my album correct. With time, these people will become more and more of a minority. Eventually, its time will come. It's just unfortunate
<br>to see something I put every fiber of my being into be discarded like this. They are not ready, and that is ok.
<br>I know what I have, I know what I made, I know what it's worth. It is not my fault many are too stupid to see it. They lack empathy
<br>and despite an outward dogmatism, see music as nothing more than entertainment for their consumption and discardment.
<br>Listen, rate, move on. Listen, rate, move on.</strong></span></p>
