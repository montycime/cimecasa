        It is around this point of our yearly cycle in which I find myself at my lowest points of psycho-emotional stability:
        <br>every trough feels yet deeper than the last.
        <br>With a capricious yet imposing timing, mercurial temperaments of listless melancholy transform into manic & short-sighted suicidal ideation.
        <br>I am so tired of living my life like this—being perceived as I am by others around me.
        <br>I find no passion nor joy in schoolwork, and any such pleasure must be forcefully wrung out of music.
        <br>With that said, I am pleased to report that I am making solid progress on my next project
        <br>& I would like to share some more information about it with you.
        <br>
        <br>Laurels of the End of History is looking to be about 10-15 minutes long & I am very excited
        <br>to announce that it will be mixed, mastered, and co-produced by Anna Lily.
        <br>I’m looking at an early 2023 release. It will feature instrumental work from Anna herself,
        <br>as well as Farkas Aron (AKA Composition Booklet), [redacted], Loto, and others yet to be announced.</strong>

    It's ok that people have completely misunderstood the point of my album. It's ok that they don't like it.
    <br>Where I begin to take issues, however, is when people make their disliking of my album a matter of culture or authencitity.
<br> I have put more thought and work into this project than these people could ever know, they scrape the surface
<br> of my themes for superficial criticisms and then have the nerve to say things like "it is lost in translation" or
<br> "the passion is obviously there, it just comes across as a superficial impersonation." You don't even know what this 
<br>album is about in the first place. Your critical media analysis begins and ends with the title of the album and a quick
<br>glance through the lyrical content. But none of these people when they engage with my album critically dare to touch any
<br>of the album which is not historical, but is instead about me, about nearly dying, about transitioning, about discovering
<br>myself. They don't stop and think; the tagline "a story of two halves told in three parts about one People shattered into seven
<br>and one Person taping themselves back together" wasn't chosen haphazardly. The release date wasn't chosen haphazardly. The lyrical
<br>content wasn't chosen haphazardly. I don't want to hear claims of impersonation when these people cannot even bother to contemplate
<br>about what is really being said. Instead, they pontificate amongst themselves, poking fun until it's time to move on. None of these
<br>people ever bother to engage in a conversation with me, because they know they're in the wrong at the end of the day.
<br>These people could never begin to comprehend the care and passion that went behind every single thought going into this project &
<br>they either do not anticipate or fear vulnerability and authencitity in music. And in this regard, they simply prove a huge facet of
<br>my album correct. With time, these people will become more and more of a minority. Eventually, its time will come. It's just unfortunate
<br>to see something I put every fiber of my being into be discarded like this. They are not ready, and that is ok.
<br>I know what I have, I know what I made, I know what it's worth. It is not my fault many are too stupid to see it. They lack empathy
<br>and despite an outward dogmatism, see music as nothing more than entertainment for their consumption and discardment.
<br>Listen, rate, move on. Listen, rate, move on.</strong></span>

<br>Happy anniversary to the founding of cime.casa! Thank you for sticking with me for this long :)

<br>The invention of barbed wire was one of the most important and consequential events in the
<br>United States' development of and expansion into the West. While fences existed and were
<br>used to mark private land, keep livestock within a specified area, and keep unwanted
<br>trespassers out, they were prone to natural damage over time and would need to be replaced,
<br>with potential losses from a faulty or broken fence being devastating, particularly if the fences
<br>are being used to keep livestock within their bounds. Barbed wire was cheaper than fence, was
<br>not prone to natural wearing, and was easier to install. However, there was a very distinct
<br>and defining purpose between fences of old and barbed wire of present. Fences are meant only to protect,
<br>while barbed wire, while also protecting something, is also meant to harm & punish
<br>those who challenge its presence. With a simple change, Man's relationship with nature
<br>changed from one defined by veneration & respect to hostility as the west grew.
<br>
<br>The cowboys died alone and divided.

<br>As we venture further into the third decade of the 21st century, we reach and promptly fly past
<br>the milestone of a century since the 1920s. A fact that seems rather passe, but is, in fact,
<br>monumental to the history of music. The 20s saw the perfection of the design of the
<br>microphone, leading to not the beginning of recorded music but the beginning of its
<br>cultural significance through radio and shellac records. A century out, we are in a peculiar
<br>situation where we see an unfettered availability to recordings, compositions, video footage, etc. from
<br>any point in music history, but as is the case with literally everything else upon the development
<br>of the internet, none of this knowledge became easier to engage with or “freed” from the
<br>Information Superhighway. In reality, all it’s done is pile even more shit for us to wade through.
<br>With copyright limiting transformative usage of much of this as well, it’s no wonder that a lot of
<br>this music remains locked in the past for one reason or another.
<br>
<br>
With this in mind, something like the release of Buena Vista Social Club seems like a
<br>miracle–which is it! 70-90 year old musicians recording folk/jazz songs from decades that, even
<br>back then, were long past. Coming out in the 90s, as a point of comparison, where the last
<br>World War I documentary that featured living veteran interviews were released. These are
<br>compositions every musician on the record had held with them for their entire lives, and without
<br>the chance encounter and opportunity to record it with modern audio production equipment and
<br>techniques, there’s a good chance that they would have, if they were even lucky enough to have
<br>recorded them, stayed trapped on old 20s and 30s shellacs. I’ve been listening to a good deal of
<br>music from this era for inspiration/studying old, mostly defunct genres of music. They work,
<br>they’re sometimes not even that bad, but it’s a travesty nonetheless. None of these are truly
<br>“preserved” in my opinion, a criteria which can only be met when media is readily available to be
<br>engaged with in its intended form. Poor fidelity recordings simply are not that and, if there was a
<br>choice offered to these artists at the time, none of them would have gone for it. 
<br>
<br>They are available, which I previously said, but not accessible to the Layman or the curious;
<br>engaging with old music, more often than not, feels like walking in a dark cave. This has much
<br>to do with poor documentation. The fact is, most people don’t care to write about recorded
<br>music until the 50s with few transcendent exceptions, such as Pete Seeger, Ella Fitzgerald,
<br>Great American Songbook composers like Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, or
<br>foundational jazz legends like Louis Armstrong, Django Reinhardt, Duke Ellington, etc.,
<br>which are, of course, such a small, small portion of the incredible variety of music from that era. A
<br>huge number of acts and recordings remain functionally lost, leaving us with hardly anything
<br>resembling a corpus to meaningfully analyze, take inspiration from, modernize, recontextualize,
<br>or deconstruct–which only becomes more difficult to accomplish with the presence of copyright
<br>laws. Folk music as a genre persists to this day, but like fences and barbed wire killed the
<br>vaquero, copyright and the triumph of the individual songwriter over communal spirit killed the
<br>troubadour.
