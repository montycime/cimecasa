In the nearby department (it's like a state or a province) of Yoro, every year, up to four times a year, an event called 'la Lluvia de Peces,' or the Rain of Fish, where it.. you guessed it.. rains fish is celebrated. This is said to have started when Spanish missionary Father José Manuel de Jesús Subirana saw how poor and hungry the people of Honduras were and prayed for three days and three nights for a miracle to feed them. After he ended, a dark cloud was said to appear and it rained fish, feeding everyone. It still happens to this day. Isn't that wonderful? Central America is an ethereal region.
