Verse 1 (Cime):
<br>
<br>
Alguna vez en algun ano pasado<br>
Yo aprendi a caminar<br>
Y yo me fui por donde me daba la gana<br>
<br>
<br>
(One time in a year long past<br>
I learned how to walk<br>
And I went wherever I felt like going)<br>

some time ago a long time ago<br>
i learned how to be free<br>
and free I was for a minute i forgot it<br>

Verse 2 (El Cafe Atomico):<br>
<br>
Alguna vez en algun ano pasado<br>
Yo naci en el centro del caos<br>
Hijo del ruido y la furia<br>
Esperando un futuro mejor<br>
Muy, muy lejos de aca, compay<br>
Pero entre el ruido y la furia<br>
Un camino se encuentra<br>
Un puente de fuego<br>
Que te abraza<br>
Y te quema<br>
Y te mata<br>
Y te ama<br>
Y te libera<br>
Y te muestra un futuro mejor<br>
Aca, aca, aca!<br>
<br>
(Sometime ago in some year ago<br>
I was born in the center of the chaos<br>
A son of noise and of fury<br>
Waiting for a better future<br>
Far, far away from here, Compay<br>
You’ll find a road<br>
A bridge of fire<br>
That embraces you<br>
And burns you<br>
And kills you<br>
And loves you<br>
And liberates you<br>
And shows you a better future<br>
Here, here, here!)<br>

Bridge (Cime):<br>
Si queres estar libre<br>
Tienes que pasar<br>
Pensando en tu futuro<br>
Nos espera ---Bolivar---<br>
Ya no se canso todo<br>
Y lo puedes cambiar<br>
Si andamos caminando compay<br>
Se puede lograr<br>

You have to spend time<br>
Thinking about your future<br>
Bolivar waits for us<br>
Nothing is ever truly over<br>

We can accomplish it)<br>

After all that was said and was done, triunfo la ---patria–-- -the homeland had won.<br>
Parties united, the regions incited–wrested it from the hands of Spain.<br>
But as they looked to one another in their liberated lands of love, passion turns to politics.<br>
Their gaze turned inwards, and the dissolution had already begun.<br>

It's hard when your friends<br>

Such a love for music<br>
In a country that won’t conduce it<br>

Passion for the art<br>
Even though you’d never chart<br>

You’re the hero and the only hero<br>
In a country across the sea, oh<br>
Not much gives me pride in my name<br>
But I know you probably felt the same<br>
Guillermo, I miss you<br>

So, here's a fun fact for you... Francisco Morazan ----died the day that independence was declared for Central America...--- isn't that just crazy?<br>
Like, what a weird coincidence... you know?<br>
Um, it's almost too perfect to be–to be a coincidence, you know?<br>
It's crazy how things work like that<br>
<br>
You’ve been a teacher to me<br>
I will come to see you<br>
We can talk for hours, Guillermo<br>
Honduras still cries for you<br>

Guillermo, yo te quiero!<br>
Guillermo, yo te quiero!<br>
O, Guillermo, cuando te veo otra vez?<br>
Te extrano tanto, Guillermo<br>

This isn't new<br>
It's always happening<br>

And we never went back again<br>

the ---Filibusters--- chose him<br>
he can't be earnest<br>
he doesn't come from the heart<br>
and the filibusters<br>
don't even let me start<br>
<br>
you may have doubts<br>
it may be painful<br>
but anything is better<br>
then being chained by the ankles<br>

it never ends, it's an age old story<br>
in the 20s in the 80s even now, it gets boring<br>

you may not know it but now you will<br>
being yourself is following His will<br>

it never ends, it's an age old story<br>
in the 20s in the 80s even now, it gets boring<br>
<br>
if you're gay, trans, bi, or lesbian<br>
if you're an artist and not sure you'll fit in<br>
<br>
it never ends, it's an age old story<br>
in the 20s in the 80s even now, it gets boring<br>
<br>
and if that upsets you, well that's ok<br>
just take a look to the other way<br>
the filibusters promote democracy<br>
by ---arming troops that kill indiscriminately---<br>
the filibusters always invoke God<br>
while they play one like a fraud<br>
it's blasphemy it's hegemony<br>

Always in rebellion, we kept on fighting... sometimes we won, sometimes we didn’t.<br>
Sometimes we won and still lost, but we always lost what we won.<br>
Unfinished–our land is unwritten, words composed but never arranged. A region liberated, but its people estranged.<br>
Started with wars for our Gods, now our Gods are drugs.<br>
We sacrifice each other for their blessing.<br>
<br>
It’s never too late to change. You can always rewrite your name, you just can’t rewrite the pain.<br>

will i ever buy a home for my mama<br>
will i ever do anything at all<br>
<br>
or will the peanut gallery chastise me<br>
for expressing artistic insecurity<br>
or for saying something they can't relate to<br>
"it's not depression porn, what am i supposed to do?"<br>
never been asked to comprehend another view<br>
so you just pick a few words out, one or two<br>
surely this isn't about me, it's all about you<br>
always about you, forever about you<br>
<br>
200 years, what came of them?<br>
we broke our chains, now we're re-chateled<br>
we freed ourselves, then we sold ourselves<br>
just to feed ourselves, now it's gone to hell<br>
the bind is strong, yes, it's stronger than the bond<br>
of the union, which to our own past belongs<br>
Morazan still lives within us<br>
he is not dead, hope is not dead<br>
God is not dead, we are not dead<br>

I'm a girl, an artist, child of the maize---<br>
---and that bird is going to sing one of these days---<br>
one day one day one day<br>
<br>
a back up plan seems stupid to me<br>
even though i nearly didn't get my high school degree<br>
now I'm still struggling first year in college<br>
---but this time with the knowledge of beans and toast<br>
the knowledge of strawberries feeling morose---<br>
the knowledge of God's love for his daughter the most<br>
<br>
and of the filibuster the snake and the jaguar<br>
the car the job the dictatorship<br>
being earnest and not ironic<br>
with my conviction i'll stick<br>
<br>
moving forward<br>
or sinking or freezing<br>
or being shot or raped<br>
die in the revolution of my mind<br>
by my own soft hands<br>
<br>
cry to try and evolve<br>
from my swollen glands<br>
<br>
or just sit inside<br>
just sit inside<br>
just sit inside<br>
just sit inside<br>
just sit inside<br>
<br>
maybe someday we'll look back<br>
new tomorrows will be the yesteryears of old<br>
choosing the right path and walking down it<br>
totally completed, the project went gold<br>
<br>
or maybe you'll look back<br>
and turn to a ---pillar of salt---<br>
punished for your hesitation<br>
in retrospect, who will you blame?<br>
who will you name?<br>
who will be at fault when to rest you are lain?<br>
who will continue your legacy or does it end there?<br>
are you fulfilled?<br>
are you insecure?<br>
if you passed away tomorrow would you leave any regrets<br>
would you leave any unpaid debts<br>
would you leave behind any trace of who you were for all who come next?<br>
this may seem pretentious but i promise it isn't<br>
look at the title of the album what does it mean<br>
if you've been listening the question is obvious it seems<br>
so lastly, i ask with full earnest intent<br>
how am i supposed to celebrate with laughter and merriment<br>
