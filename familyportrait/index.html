    <p style="font-size:35px" align=center><strong><span style="background-color: #000000">First and foremost, I want to thank my mother and Hex for their support--financial or otherwise--throughout this project.
    <br>Second, this album is specially dedicated to the memories of Guillermo Anderson and Gloria Argumedo. Thank you for everything, I hope I get to meet you both again soon (but not too soon)
    <br>I want to continue with a series of deep, meaningful displays of gratitude. Thank you to Frank, Aron, and Zach for your work. This wouldn't have been the same without any of you. Thank you to James (Rozwell) for your patience and attentiveness to the project; what I could only approximate, you made into reality. Thank you to Skylar and Vinny for your consistent backing; I couldn't have chosen better musicians to follow me throughout this journey. On that note, thank you to Lila and Ven for your artistic contributions throughout the years--you are both phenomenal artists. Thank you to Halldor for providing a wonderful platform for my essays, having your support throughout has truly made the difference.</span></strong></p>
